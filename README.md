## Styling Guide

Styling is managed through SCSS, ensuring a modern look and feel to the application. The BEM methodology was used along with variables for consistency.

1. **Variables**: All SCSS variables are defined in `variables.scss`. This includes colors, font sizes, and common margins/paddings.
2. **Custom Styles**: Custom styles can be found in `styles.scss`. This includes component-specific styles and utility classes.

3. **Using Bootstrap**: Bootstrap's grid system and components are used for responsiveness. However, the primary color schemes are customized for consistency. Always refer to variables when styling new components.
